This is the repository for Michael and Karla's lab 5

What the project does
For our mini project we will be creating the game pong
Our project is a classic game of pong, once the player reaches 5 points 
the next level starts and the screen changes to a different color

anyone has freetime they can play our pong game.

source code to make their own copy.

Where users can get help with your project

try our best to help resolve their issue. If Karla or Michael are not reachable, users
can also check YouTube because there are numerous tutorial videos.

the game and resolving any bug issues that may occur.
