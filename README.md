# Lab-5
This is the repository for Michael and Karla's lab 5

What the project does
For our mini project we will be creating the game pong
Our project is a classic game of pong, once the player reaches 5 points 
the next level starts and the screen changes to a different color

Why the project is useful
Our pong game is useful because we have no ads and it is free to play! If
anyone has freetime they can play our pong game.
